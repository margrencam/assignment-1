## Exercise 1

## Exercise 2

```{r}
possible_outcomes <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
outcome_probabilities <- c(0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05)
n_data_points <- 400

set.seed(1)
fake_data_points <- sample(possible_outcomes,
                          n_data_points,
                          replace=T,
                          prob=outcome_probabilities)
set.seed(NULL)

fake_data_set <- tibble::data_frame(`Fake measurement`=fake_data_points)
```

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(fake_data_set, ggplot2::aes(x=`Fake measurement`)) +
ggplot2::geom_histogram(bins=5, colour="black", fill="lightgrey")
```

Statement 1 (written prior to reading example statements in PDF)

* My understanding is that 400 fake data points have been generated by R according to the parameters outlined in the code.
* The "possible_outcomes" refer to the possible data points that can be generated.  In this case, the possibilities are the whole integers 0-5.
* I assume that the "outcome_probabilities" refers to the respective probabilities of the possible data points.  For example, the possible data point 0 has a probability of 0.1 ; in other words, there is a 10% chance of a data point 0 being generated.
* "n_data_points" specifies the number of data points to be generated. In this case, 400.

Rewriting of Statements, conforming to the convention of writing one "statement" for each separate line of code.  (written after reading example statements in PDF)

Statement 1

* "possible_outcomes" is the name of a numeric variable, and the contents of the variable are the whole integers 0-5.
* The data points generated in the console are, indeed, restricted to occurances of the whole integers 0-5, which confirms that these are the possible outcomes.

Statement 2

* "outcome_probabilities" is a variable for which the contents are the respective distributions of the possible outcomes.  
* Each probability is matched up to an outcome.  For example, the probability of the outcome 1 is 0.5 or 50%. Half of the data points generated can be expected to be 1.

Statement 3

* n_data_points is a variable that determines how many data points will be generated.  In this case, 400.
* To verify, I counted the last line of the data points generated in the Console, up from 377, and got 400.

Statement 4

* I had to look up what the "set.seed" function is.  From what I understand, it has to do with controlling the randomness of the data point generation so that the same data can be "randomly" generated by the same code during different sessions on the same computer, or on a different computer.  

Statement 5

* "fake_data_points" is the variable whose contents are the 400-point sample generated with the above parameters.
* I looked up the meaning of "replace=T".  It is a function that allows the possible outcomes to be sampled more than once.  This is useful for our particular data set, as there are only 6 possible outcomes, but we need to generate 400 data points. 
* sample takes a sample of the specified size from the elements available (in this case the possible_outcomes), either with or without replacement (in this case, with replacement)
* Our sample function chooses elements available from possible_outcomes, 400 of them (n_data_points), allows for replacement (explained above), at the probability weights for the sampled vector (given in outcome_probabilities)

Statement 6

* I looked up what a data frame in R is.  It is used for storing data tables.  It is a list of vectors of equal length.  Tibble is a particular type of data frame, one which allows for more efficient coding.

## Exercise 3

```{r}
iris_groups23 <- dplyr::filter(iris, Species %in% c("versicolor", "virginica"))
ggplot2::ggplot(iris_groups23, ggplot2::aes(x=Sepal.Width)) +
ggplot2::geom_histogram(colour="black", fill="lightgrey", binwidth=0.1) +
ggplot2::facet_grid(Species ~ .)
```

Explanation of Histogram

* Y-axis : the number of flowers observed that have a given sepal width.  For example, there is 1 versicolor iris with a sepal width of 2.0 cm
* The intervals of the Y-axis are counter-intuitive, as it is not possible to have non-whole integers as a flower count.  Though this does not directly affect the accuracy of the graph, it does make it difficult to interpret.

* X-axis : the measured sepal width of a given flower, in centimeters
* As outlined in the Assignment 1 instructions, the bins of the histogram (the sepal width measurement values in which the "tokens" of the flowers with that particular width are placed) are spaced every 0.1 cm, not including the upper value.  The bins on the X-axis are 2.0-2.1 (not including 2.1), 2.1-2.2 (not including 2.2), etc.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Versicolor Iris Histogram.jpg")
``` 

```{r}
library(magrittr)
iris_versicolor_subset <- dplyr::filter(iris,
Sepal.Width <= 2.5,
Species == "versicolor") %>%
dplyr::select(Sepal.Width, Species)
knitr::kable(iris_versicolor_subset)
```
Verification of combined histogram using 4 bins 
* Bin 1 : Sepal width 2.2-2.3 cm, contains 3 flowers
* Bin 2 : Sepal width 2.6-2.7 cm, contains 5 flowers
* Bin 3 : Sepal width 3.0-3.1 cm, contains 20 flowers
* Bin 4 : Sepal width 3.3-3.4 cm, contains 4 flowers
Sampled bins match between the two separate graphs and the combined graph.

Explanation of Hypothesis A :
* If the viginica and versicolor iris species are the same in terms of sepal width, that means that the observed measurements for the two flower species exhibt the same distribution.  They don't necessarily show all the same measurements, but the observed measurements can reasonably be patterned in the same manner.  There is no significant (above chance) difference between the meaurement distributions for the two different species.

Explanation of Hypothesis B :
* If the two species are different in terms of sepal width, that means that their measurements do not follow the same distribution.  Even if there is some overlap between the collected measurements, the measurements cannot be predicted by the same pattern for the two groups.  There is a significant (above chance) difference between the measurement distributions.

Looking at the three graphics, I am generally in favor of Hypothesis A : that the two species are the same in terms of sepal width.  Although the virginica iris shows more occurances of flowers with greater sepal width, both species show a relatively normal distribution of sepal widths with their respective averages near 3.0cm. 


## Exercise 4

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(stressshift::stress_shift_permit,
                ggplot2::aes(x=Category, fill=Syllable)) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(position="dodge", colour="black") +
  ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set3")
```

```{r}
ggplot2::ggplot(stressshift::stress_shift_permit, ggplot2::aes(x=0, fill=Syllable)) +
  ggplot2::geom_bar(position="dodge", colour="black") +
  ggplot2::scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set3") +
  ggplot2::xlab("") +
  ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x=ggplot2::element_blank(),
                axis.ticks.x=ggplot2::element_blank()) +
ggplot2::xlim(c(-1,1))
```

* Hypothesis A : Noun and Verb are the same in terms of their stress.  This hypothesis predicts that the noun and verb forms of the word "permit" will exhibit the same distribution of syllable stress.  Any difference between the patterns of syllable stress shown between the noun and verb forms will not be significantly higher than chance level.  We would predict to observe that both the noun and verb form of "permit" are "stressed" in the same way ; either both on the first syllable, both on the second syllable, or both on a mix of the two syllables.
* Hypothesis B : Noun and verb are different in terms of their stress.  This hypothesis predicts that the noun and verb forms of the word "permit" will exhibit different distributions of syllable stress.  The difference in stress pattern between the noun and verb forms will be significantly greater than chance level.  We would predict that the noun and verb form of "permit" are not "stressed" on the same syllable.

The two hypotheses cannot be evaluated on the basis of the second graph because in that graph we cannot observe the respective distributions of syllable stress for the two word classes.  The first graph, however, does allow for a visual comparison of the syllable stress distribution for the two words.

The first set of graphs, in which the respective stress distributions of the noun and verb forms of "permit" are shown, coupled with the known stress pattern of two-syllable words that can alter between a noun and verb form, lead me to conclude in favor of Hypothesis B : Permit (noun) and permit (verb) are different in terms of their stress.  Purely on the basis of the first graph, it can be observed that the noun form has a very strong tendancy to be stressed on the first syllabe, and the verb form is overwhelmingly stressed on the second.  Although the noun form does show about 22% (10/45) syllable stress on the second syllable, the distribution does not exhibit the same pattern as that for the verb form.

One possible explanation for the variation in the indicated syllable stress of the noun form in dictionaries is changes/variation in syllable stress marking conventions, given the time-span of the collected data.  Another possible explanation is dialectical differences between dictionaries.
